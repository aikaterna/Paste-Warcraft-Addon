All rights reserved to oscarub on his original work on the version of this plugin, which was updated until 2016.

While every effort will be made by me to keep this addon operational in Dragonflight and beyond, I am not a LUA coder so pull requests are welcome. By offering a pull request to this repository, you are waiving your rights to remove the code at a future date and you renounce all claims of owning the code provided. This notice is because the original files provided by oscarucb are not licensed and I will not claim any of this code as my own.

ACE3 files are bundled with this plugin as I am unsure that the current version of ACE3 is supported with this plugin, and I will be testing this at a future date and possibly removing the bundled files or providing more instructions on how to use ACE3 with this plugin. For the record, all rights are reserved by the code owners. See https://github.com/WoWUIDev/Ace3/blob/master/LICENSE.txt for more information.
